\problemname{Conversation Log}

Popular social networking site My+Din is struggling to manage its many
popular forums. Recent regulation requires the site to report users engaged in
conversations about certain topics. The sheer number of users means manual
monitoring is too costly and so the site has asked its many interns to come up
with a solution.

One intern has theorized that conversations about any given topic will see the
same key words used over and over. If the most used words can be identified
perhaps manual investigation can be directed towards appropriate forums.

\section*{Input}

\begin{itemize}

\item One line containing a single integer $M$ ($1 \le M \le 10^4$), the number
of messages.

\item $M$ more lines each beginning with a user's name of no more than $20$
characters and continuing with the content of that user's message all in lower
case. The total number of characters across all messages, including spaces,
will not exceed $2 \times 10^6$.

\end{itemize}

\section*{Output}

Several words, one per line, listing the words used by every single user on the
forum, ordered from most to least used and in case of a tie in alphabetical
order. If there are no such words, output \textbf{ALL CLEAR}.
