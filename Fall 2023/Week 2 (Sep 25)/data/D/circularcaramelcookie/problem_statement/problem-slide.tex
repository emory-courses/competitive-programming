                \item Calculate the minimum radius of a stroopwafel with strictly more than $1 \leq s \leq 10^9$ squares.
                \item The area of each square is $1~\text{cm}^2$.
                \item The centre point of the stroopwafel always contains the common
                corner of the four adjacent squares in the centre
                (i.e., the squares are aligned to a Cartesian grid).
