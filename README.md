# M||E Competitive Programming

**M||E** (pronounced "Emory") **Competitive Programming** is a student-led organization interested in [competitive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming) that requires proficient skills in problem solving, efficient coding, and error handling. 
We provide training sessions and practice tests to prepare for the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), and we are an official college-wide recognized organization at [theHub](https://thehub.emory.edu/organization/m-or-e).
The Emory teams have participated in [the ICPC Southeast USA Regional Programming Contest](http://seusa.vanb.org) for many years and have consistently been among the top 3 schools.
We strive for our teams to advance to the ICPC World Final, one of the most prestigious competitions for undergraduates in Computer Science.

## Resources

### Past Sessions
Please go to the folder "Fall 2022 - Spring 2023" or "Fall 2023" for Rudi's sessions, with algorithms implemented.

###  Problem Banks & Contests
* [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/problems) Past server that clones or reposits most NAQ, Regional, NAC, and/or ICPC problems. It is being phased about by DOMJudge, but DOMJudge's problems would typically not be open for submission.
* [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) - Popular competitive programming website.
* [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/) - Popular competitive programming website.
* [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) - Targets job interviews
* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) - Targets job interviews.

### Learning Topics and Algorithms

## Leadership
Most of our members are now seniors! Thanks to the seniors who have joined and grown with us. For rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors, please remember to email simon.bian@emory.edu or harry.he@emory.edu for transfering the leadership of the group before May 2024. One necessary step is to add you on theHub so the school can still recognize this organization, and gradually may allot funding. We want the group to be growing!
