# Competitive Programming at Emory

Southeast, South Central, and Mid Atlantic regions will combine to form a Southern Conference. The top three *schools* from each *region* will advance to the NAC. All other wildcards will be the best finishers from the *combined* scoreboard.

## Important Dates

* ICPC NAC Virtual Career Fair: 2022-10-27
* [ICPC Southeast USA Regional Programming Contest](http://seusa.vanb.org): 2023-02-25 (tentative)


## Training Schedule

* Time: Every Friday 5 - 6:30PM
* Location: MSC W303
* [Practice contest website](https://emory.contest.codeforces.com)

## Training Resources

Problem banks & contests
* [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) - Most popular competitive programming website
* [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/) - Really good, high problem quality, more mathy problems
* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) - Targets job interviews, low quality problems
* [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) - Targets job interviews, low quality problems

Learning topics and algorithms
* [CP Algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/) - Lots of amazing tutorials
* [USACO Guide](https://usaco.guide/)
* [Yosupo's Library Checker](https://judge.yosupo.jp/) - For checking own implementation of classic algorithms

Don't go through lists of algorithms and learn them one by one, instead solve problems and learn the algorithms when you see them come up in solutions.
