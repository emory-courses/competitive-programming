# M||E Competitive Programming

**M||E** (pronounced "Emory") **Competitive Programming** is a student-led organization interested in [competitive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming) that requires proficient skills in problem solving, efficient coding, and error handling.
We provide training sessions and practice tests to prepare for the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC).
The Emory teams have participated in [the ICPC Southeast USA Regional Programming Contest](http://seusa.vanb.org) for many years and have consistently been among the top 3 schools.
We strive for our teams to advance to the ICPC World Final, one of the most prestigious competitions for undergraduates in Computer Science.

Please subscribe to our mailing list if you want to join our training sessions (Emory students only):

* Send an email to LISTSERV@listserv.emory.edu (no subject is needed).
* In the body, write `SUBSCRIBE COMPETITIVE-PROGRAMMING [your first name] [your last name]` (e.g., `SUBSCRIBE COMPETITIVE-PROGRAMMING Jeff Epstein`).

## Training Times and Locations
Recurring Monday 19:00-20:00 at MSC W301.
